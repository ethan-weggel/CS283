1. Can you think of why we use `fork/execvp` instead of just calling `execvp` directly? What value do you think the `fork` provides?

    > **Answer**:  When we call `execvp` directly this causes our currently process to morph into this other executable that is started by the syscall. This means when we are finished executin and need to return to the "parent" program, we would have nothing left to return to. By using fork we are making a new child process that can morph into running the executable and then when we are done we can go back to using the parent program (the shell), because it is left untouched.

2. What happens if the fork() system call fails? How does your implementation handle this scenario?

    > **Answer**: is the `fork()` system call fails then we know the return code for fork (which would be in the parent process) would be not equal to zero. In the case of my implementation i make sure to check if the return code is less than zero. If that is the case we simply return from the function that called the system call with the return code of `fork()`. Otherwise I continue execution as normal.

3. How does execvp() find the command to execute? What system environment variable plays a role in this process?

    > **Answer**:  `execvp()` finds the command to execute by searching through values stores in an environment variable. Specifically one called PATH. This is a list of paths that lead to binaries that are named and can be executed. In general a lot of these binaries can be found in `/bin` and that path is on the PATH environment variable. If the name of the executable we are trying to start is not present in any of the paths listed in PATH, then we return an error code and continue with shell execution.

4. What is the purpose of calling wait() in the parent process after forking? What would happen if we didnâ€™t call it?

    > **Answer**:  Calling `wait()` in the parent process ensures that we are waiting for the child process to completely finish out its execution before we continue as the parent. This means the child process must return with a return code before continuing. This is done to make sure that the parent doesn't continue execution which could result in "weird things" happening. For instance, if we were waiting to see the return code of the child process in the parent but we didn't wait, we could use the wrong value or have a memory error in our code that could go unnoticed or cause a crash. In the case of my program that is certainly the case. However, in general, one could imagine forking and then booting an executable in the child process such as a file copying process. If we didn't wait for the child to be done we might be limited in resources or we could have mixed output on our screen which could be very confusing for the user.

8. For this quesiton, you need to do some research on Linux signals. You can use [this google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&oq=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzc2MGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to get started.
